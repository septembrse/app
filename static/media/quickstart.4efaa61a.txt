You join the Virtual Conference Center by clicking the link in the
[Today Page](/#app/today) (the link will only appear from Friday 3rd September
onwards, if you are logged in, and your ticket is valid that day).

It is strongly recommended that you connect using a
[Chromium-based browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)),
e.g. Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Vivaldi etc. We have had success
with Firefox, but have seen slow rendering. Safari does not work well
and is not recommended.

# Signing in

The Virtual Conference Center is built using [gather.town](https://gather.town).
Access is managed via a Guest List. When you first connect you will see
a screen that looks something like this;

Click connect, and you will be asked to sign in. Use the "Email" option
and sign in using the email address to which your SeptembRSE ticket was sent.

Gather.town will email you a one-time code that you can use to sign in.
Check your email (including your spam folder) to see if it arrives. If
it doesn't arrive within 5 minutes then get in contact with us,
e.g. [via email](mailto:conference-2021@society-rse.org) or via the
#septembrse channel in the RSE Slack.

Enter your code where requested;

You will next be taken to a page to choose your avatar.

This page lets you edit your Avatar (by clicking the "Edit" button), and
to choose your video camera, microphone and speakers. Once you are ready,
click "Join the Gathering" to enter the Virtual Conference Center.
