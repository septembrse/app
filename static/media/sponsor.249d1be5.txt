# Information for Sponsors

Contributor, Partner and Networker sponsors have virtual booths in the
main conference hall. For example, here is what the Society's booth
could look like;

Booths are constructed from tiles. Each tile is 32x32 pixels. Each tile
can only contain one avatar and/or interactable item.

* Contributer booths are 10x10 tiles (320x320 pixels)
* Partner booths are 8x8 tiles (256x256 pixels)
* Networker booths are 6x6 tiles (192x192 pixels)

# How can I design our booth?

Booths can be entirely designed by you, e.g. by creating an image of the
required pixel size, and taking into account that avatars will occupy
single tiles (32x32 pixels wide). Alternatively, you can supply us with
graphics and we can build a booth by putting furniture on top of those
graphics (e.g. as we have done here for the Society - standard booth
furniture has been placed over the Society logo, and a name tag
added to the bottom right).

A good piece of advice is that you first decide what you want your booth to
link to (e.g. web pages, Google docs or Google forms, YouTube videos, etc).
Once you know that, position those things in your tiles. Think about how
people will know what they are. Also think about whether people will be
blocked by anything (so which tiles are impassable because, e.g.
there is a table or a board there).

When you are ready, [email us your graphics and instructions](mailto:conference-2021@society-rse.org)
and we will build it into the conference center as quickly as possible.
We will invite you to have a look at your booth before the conference, if you
would like, and can iterate the design if needed.

# What should I put in the booth?

We recommend that the best things to put in your booth are things that
can be interacted with. For example, in the Society booth we have added
a board that contains a hyperlink to the Society sign-up page. We have also
added computers on the desk that contain hyperlinks to the Society
web pages.

Your booth can contain links to anything you want. You can link to videos,
websites, images, login pages for free trials, or to sign-up pages that
you can use to arrange meetings with conference attendees. You can even
embed Zoom links (or similar) to have people join demonstrations or
other events at your booth. If you have an idea, then please
[get in touch with us to discuss](mailto:conference-2021@society-rse.org)
and we can let you know if it will work.

# What if I don't have time to design a booth?

We are happy to create a general booth for you based on any logos or
other graphics you email to us. Please also send a link to a web page
or similar that the booth can link to, if you want people to be able
to interact with your booth.

# Do I need to stand in my booth?

We recommend that you don't have someone permanently staffing your booth.
Instead, leave a sign-up page, Zoom link or other mechanism to get attention and
feel free to explore and walk around the conference center. People are
more likely to interact with your booth if they don't feel like they are being
watched. Equally, you will have more meaningful interactions
and build stronger relationships with conference
attendees by mixing with them and taking part in the various activities.
This is your conference as much as anyone elses - enjoy it and get as
much out of it as everyone else :-)

# How long will my booth be up?

The virtual conference center will remain up and open long after the
conference. Attendance will be limited after the conference to just
25 people. If you want, we can leave your booth up after the conference.
Alternatively, if you want us to remove it, we can remove your booth
when you request. Just [email us](mailto:conference-2021@society-rse.org) to let us know.

# What if I don't want a booth?

Just [email us](mailto:conference-2021@society-rse.org) to let us know and
we will remove your booth from the conference hall.
