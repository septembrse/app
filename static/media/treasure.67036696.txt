# The Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt

We will be running a treasure hunt throughout the conference.
Each week, various clues will be hidden throughout the map. Your task,
as an individual or as part of a team, will be to find each clue by
decoding the one previous. There will be a leaderboard of which
people or teams are finding the clues the quickest, and a prize
for the winning team(s) that will be awarded at the end of the
conference.

Clues will be encoded by an increasinly sophisticated algorithm that
you will have to write a program to decode. This will be a challenge
of both your ability to solve riddles, write code, and find objects.

Are you or your team up to the challenge?

If so, more details will be made available at the start of the
conference. Good luck!
