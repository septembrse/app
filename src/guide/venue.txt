# What can I do in the Virtual Conference Center?

The conference center is filled with lots of different things to
interact with. We don't want to spoil the surprise, and do really
encourage you to explore.

# The Lecture Theatre

The Lecture Theatre is where all of the talk and presentations will
be held.

Simply follow the arrows in the center to find the lecture theatre at
the bottom of the conference center. Find an empty seat, and then
press "x" to join the Zoom call for the presentation. This will automatically
disconnect you from the conference center and will start and connect
you to Zoom.

When you disconnect from Zoom you will automatically be returned to the
conference center. Feel free to talk to the people around you after
the presentation to discuss what you've seen.

# The Picnic Tables

There are many social spaces throughout the confernece center. There is also
a garden with lots to explore. In the garden you will find many picnic
tables.

These are zones where you can gather in a group for a virtual
lunch or virtual coffee. Only people whose avatars are in the picnic
table zone will be able to interact with each other.

# The Registration Desk

We have a registration desk in the conference center.

This will be staffed
at key times by members of the conference committee, who can answer your
questions. There will be links to send messages to the committee when
it is not staffed. There will also be links to feedback forms etc.

# What else?

There is a lot to explore. Ultimately though, the value of the conference
center will be mainly derived from how much you use it. Please do treat
it like a real conference center. Walk up to and talk to others. Go
and sit at the tables and talk to the people sat around you. Arrange
to meet up with your group at the picnic table near the zen garden.
Find the arcade zone and play games with each other. Enjoy a moonlit
walk (yes, in the evening, the sun will go down and the moon will come out).

This is your conference venue - make the most of it :-)
