# Quick Start Guide

You join the Virtual Conference Center by clicking the link in the
[Today Page](/#app/today) (the link will only appear on the days the
conference is open, if you are logged in, and your ticket is valid
that day).

It is strongly recommended that you connect using a
[Chromium-based browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)),
e.g. Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Vivaldi etc. We have had success
with Firefox, but have seen slow rendering. Safari does not work well
and is not recommended.
