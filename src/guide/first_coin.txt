# The Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt

The clue to decode the first coin is;

üìù‚û°Ô∏èüîü‚û°Ô∏èb64

The content of the first coin is;

```

```

The clue to decode uses the following emojis;

* üìù = text (specifically UTF-8 encoded text)
* ‚û°Ô∏è = is converted to
* üîü = binary
* b64 = base64 encoding

You may have guessed that the content of the first coin is base64 encoded.
The clue to decode is thus the instructions by which the contents were encoded.
The clue says that the UTF-8 text of the coin was
converted to binary, which was then converted to base64 encoding.

To decode, we therefore need to reverse this process. We need to
base64 decode the contents to get the binary data. We then need
to interpret the binary data using UTF-8 to get the original contents
of the coin.

This process could be performed in many different programming languages.
A possible Python program to do this is;

```
import base64

encoded = "T3JhY2xlIENyeXB0aWMgQ29kZSBUcmVhc3VyZSBIdW50ClRyZWFzdXJlIDEgOiBDb2RlIDAxYUdoTGFTCgpIaW50IHRvIGZpbmQgdGhlIG5leHQgcGllY2Ugb2YgdHJlYXN1cmU6IFJlc2lkZW50IG9mIERlbHBoaQpIaW50IHRvIGRlY29kZSB0aGUgbmV4dCBwaWVjZSBvZiB0cmVhc3VyZTog8J+TneKeoe+4j/CflJ/inqHvuI9iNjTinqHvuI/wn6qeCg=="

#¬†base64 decode
binary = base64.b64decode(encoded)

#¬†utf8 decode
decoded = binary.decode("utf-8")

print(decoded)
```

The output from running this program is the decoded contents of the
first coin;

```
