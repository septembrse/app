# The Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt

The Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt will be running throughout the
conference. Each week 5 treasure coins will be released. The first
person (or team) that finds and submits all 20 coins will win
a prize! We will also be publishing a leader board each week so you
see how you or your team compares.

Each coin contains a clue that will help you find the next coin.
These clues are encoded using an increasingly sophisticated
algorithm that you will have to write a program to decode.
This is a challenge of your ability to solve riddles, write
code, and find objects. We really encourage you to form a team
to do this (e.g. maybe your local RSE group?). We think it will
be a lot of fun, not only as a competition, but also as a
group bonding or networking exercise. Good luck!

## The first coin

5 coins are released each week. On week 1, these are 1 coin on this
website, plus 4 coins in the Virtual Conference Center.
