# The Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt

The Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt will be running throughout the
conference. Each week 5 treasure coins will be released. The first
person (or team) that finds and submits all 20 coins will win
a prize! We will also be publishing a leader board each week so you
see how you or your team compares.

Each coin contains a clue that will help you find the next coin.
These clues are encoded using an increasingly sophisticated
algorithm that you will have to write a program to decode.
This is a challenge of your ability to solve riddles, write
code, and find objects. We really encourage you to form a team
to do this (e.g. maybe your local RSE group?). We think it will
be a lot of fun, not only as a competition, but also as a
group bonding or networking exercise. Good luck!

## The first coin

![](https://github.com/septembrse/septembrse.github.io/blob/main/images/treasure_coin.png?raw=true)

Each coin looks like the image above. 5 coins are released each week.
On week 1, these are 1 coin on this
website (the one above), plus 4 coins in the Virtual Conference Center.

The clue to decode the first coin is;

üìù‚û°Ô∏èüîü‚û°Ô∏èb64

The content of the first coin is;

```

```

Your job now is to use the above decoding clue to decode the coin's contents.

When you have done this, the result will be something like this
(this is just an example);

```
Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt
Treasure 0 : Code 00fjirSd

Hint to find the next piece of treasure: A riddle
Hint to decode the next piece of treasure: Some emojis
```

You will need to enter the code number (e.g. `00fjirSd` in this example)
into [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2oWEH3p4EvNkzyu2UuFkb49SB68T52sIvyWkivxyZgNFsiQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
The form is also linked from the Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt
booth in the Virtual Conference Center.
