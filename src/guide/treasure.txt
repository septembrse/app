# The Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt

The Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt will be running throughout the
conference. Each week 5 treasure coins will be released. The first
person (or team) that finds and submits all 20 coins will win
a prize! We will also be publishing a leader board each week so you
see how you or your team compares.

Each coin contains a clue that will help you find the next coin.
These clues are encoded using an increasingly sophisticated
algorithm that you will have to write a program to decode.
This is a challenge of your ability to solve riddles, write
code, and find objects. We really encourage you to form a team
to do this (e.g. maybe your local RSE group?). We think it will
be a lot of fun, not only as a competition, but also as a
group bonding or networking exercise.

# Here is the first coin!

Each coin looks like the image above. 5 coins are released each week.
On week 1, these are 1 coin on this
website (the one above), plus 4 coins in the Virtual Conference Center.

The clue to decode the first coin is;

üìù‚û°Ô∏èüîü‚û°Ô∏èb64

The content of the first coin is;

```

```

Your job now is to use the above decoding clue to decode the coin's contents.

When you have decoded the coin, the result will look something like this
(this is just an example);

```
Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt
Treasure 0 : Code 00fjirSd

Hint to find the next piece of treasure: A riddle
Hint to decode the next piece of treasure: Some emojis
```

You next need to enter the code number (e.g. `00fjirSd` in this example)
into [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2oWEH3p4EvNkzyu2UuFkb49SB68T52sIvyWkivxyZgNFsiQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
This form is also linked from the Oracle Cryptic Code Treasure Hunt
booth in the Virtual Conference Center.

The form will ask for your email address and either your name, or the
name of your team. The form records the timestamp of submission, which
we will use to compose the leaderboard. Note that you must submit the
codes for *all* 20 coins using the same email address to win the prize.
The winner will be the person or team who submits all 20 coins
the quickest.

If you have any questions then please get in touch via the #septembrse
channel on the RSE Slack.

Good luck!
