## Tell me more!

When you first connect, your avatar will be spawned into the respawn
zone at the top of the map.

From here, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your avatar
around the map.

If you click your name at the bottom of the screen, you can open a menu.

You can use this to set your status (e.g. here I am "Exploring").
If you ever get stuck, click "Respawn" and your avatar will be returned
to the respawn zone. If you get lost, you can view a minimap of the
entire venue by clicking on the map icon at the bottom of the screen
(the folded paper next to your name).

# How do I talk to other people?

You will be able to see and hear people whose avatars are near your avatar on the map.
Personally, we find it a better experience to switch off cameras and only
hear other people. We've found that this helps you look at the avatar
of the other person when you are speaking to them, and are not distracted
by the video. You can turn your camera on and off by clicking on the camera
icon in the box in the bottom right of the screen.

You can also click the microphone icon here to toggle mute.

By default, you will hear and be heard by everyone who is near your avatar.
You can limit this to only the people who are immediately adjacent to your
avatar by turning on "Quiet Mode" (an option in the same menu above
that was used to respawn).

The map is also filled with zones where only people whose avatars are
in those zones can communicate with one another. For example, there
is a zone for each table in the cafe;

![](https://github.com/septembrse/septembrse.github.io/blob/main/images/cafe.jpg?raw=true)

Only the person whose avatar is sat at the same table as you can hear and
interact with you. If you see someone sat alone at a table, as I am here,
then please feel free to sit in the next chair and introduce
yourself and have a chat.

There are also meeting rooms;

![](https://github.com/septembrse/septembrse.github.io/blob/main/images/meeting_room.jpg?raw=true)

Only people whose avatars are in the meeting room can interact with each other.

# Is there text chat?

Yes! There is a text chat facility accessed via the speech bubble icon
at the left of the screen. The chat is persistent. By default, you text
chat with people whose avatars are near your own. You can chat with
everyone if you wish.

# How do I interact with things?

You interact with items by walking next to them. They will light up. To
interact, you press the "x" key on your keyboard.

![](https://github.com/septembrse/septembrse.github.io/blob/main/images/info_point.jpg?raw=true)

For example, near the respawn zone are a number of Info Points. These
are information points that give you access to this Conference Information
System. Press "x" to interact. This will open a view containing
the CIS. To close the view, either click outside and press "x" again, or
click the cross at the top right of the screen.

# What else can I do?

You can do a lot! If you hold "z", you will dance! Of course, you will
need a dance zone too to show off those moves...

![](https://github.com/septembrse/septembrse.github.io/blob/main/images/dancing.jpg?raw=true)

(yes, you really can play those pianos)

# What if I get stuck?

Normally, you can't walk through the avatars of other people. This can mean
that you may get stuck in a queue. To get out, hold the "g" key and you
will ghost. As a ghost, you can walk through other avatars and you
become invisible and cannot be interacted with by others. If only
this was possible in real life ;-)
