Prizes will be awarded e.g. for fastest and most elegant solution. AWS accounts and/or platforms for deploying infrastructure will be provided to teams and we will provide an overview to help novices get started. While knowledge and experience of cloud will be useful, some programming experience, an appetite to learn, and curiosity are the only pre-requisites.

Moreover, very few ninja programmers have the expert knowledge of asynchronous programming required to use GPUs at their best.\n\nThe GrCUDA polyglot API is a significant step forward in the never-ending quest of making GPU programming more accessible. GrCUDA exposes the CUDA API to all the high-level languages supported by GraalVM, such as JavaScript, R, Python, and Scala, drastically lowering the integration efforts with these languages. But that's not all: we have recently improved GrCUDA to transparently provide asynchronous execution, hardware space-sharing, and transfer-computation overlap without requiring in advance any information about the program dependency structure.\n\nWe achieve an average of 44% speedup against synchronous execution, with no code change whatsoever!\n\nIn this Demonstration/Walkthrough, we show the strengths of GrCUDA by showcasing a complex image processing application. But no fear: you will see how easy it is to accelerate JavaScript using GPUs, achieving the same performance as the low-level C++ CUDA API, with drastically simpler code!\n\nThis project is supported by an Oracle for Research Cloud Credit Grant and research funding from Oracle research Labs.
