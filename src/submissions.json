As part of this we want to better understand the diversity of RSE and RSE-type roles and career pathways across the research landscape. We also hope to learn more about groups of individuals who do not necessarily consider themselves to be RSEs but who might benefit and appreciate becoming a part of our community.\n\nIn this workshop we\u2019ll run a series of interactive activities and breakout sessions to explore how attendees would classify themselves, and others, within the RSE landscape.

Teams will be tasked with recreating example workflows, deploying the infrastructure and running analysis.  Inspired by the reprohack model, can you take open data, create or reuse reproducible analysis and add in redeployable, democratised infrastructure?  Prizes will be awarded e.g. for fastest and most elegant solution.\nAWS accounts and/or platforms for deploying infrastructure will be provided to teams and we will provide an overview to help novices get started.  While knowledge and experience of cloud will be useful, some programming experience, an appetite to learn, and curiosity are the only pre-requisites.  We positively encourage registrations from teams drawn from across the research spectrum, researchers, from RSEs and Research Compute teams.  As well as having fun can we get out of our silos after recent challenges.\nEverything will be run subject and according to whatever COVID rules are in place at the time.  With this in mind we currently envisage that teams of up to five will be supported by a solutions architect at six locations across the country in addition to our offices in London, we will provide lunch and evening meal.  We also intend to have solution architects available virtually to support a number of teams joining remotely if they are unable to or would prefer not to attend in person.

A public panel where several (preferably senior) RSEs and software developers talk openly about mistakes they've made in software they've developed. 2. A private confession room and/or noticeboard where developers can anonymously disclose their confessions. In the private room an \"absolver\" would listen to the confessions and make notes about the issues.
